# My Vite React App

This project is a simple React application built with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS. It serves as a template for creating modern web applications with a fast development experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-vite-react-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd my-vite-react-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view your application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of your application, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory.

### Usage

You can modify the `src/App.tsx` file to change the main application component. Additional components can be created in the `src/components` directory.

### Customizing Tailwind CSS

To customize Tailwind CSS, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can add custom colors, fonts, and other design tokens.

## Project README File

# üåø Blockchain-Based Green Labeling & Carbon Neutrality Platform

This project enables transparent carbon credit retirement and issuance of verifiable green labels using blockchain, IPFS, and smart contracts. Built to integrate UCR-issued carbon credits and empower both brands and consumers to validate carbon neutrality claims.

---

## üöÄ Goal

Build a decentralized platform that:

- Integrates UCR-issued carbon credits.
- Retires credits transparently via smart contracts.
- Issues verifiable green labels and certificates.
- Enables supply chain and consumer traceability.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### 1. Carbon Credit Integration Layer
- Interface with UCR via API/CSV.
- Tokenize credits on-chain (ERC-1155).
- Record retirement hash transparently.

### 2. Smart Contract Layer
- Register product batches and emissions.
- Match credits and execute retirement.
- Mint optional green certificate NFT.

### 3. Blockchain Layer
- Deploy on Polygon / Ethereum / Celo.
- Store metadata on IPFS.

### 4. Green Label Module
- Generate QR-linked green label.
- Display carbon footprint, credit info, verifier signature, timestamp.

### 5. Verification & Reporting
- IPFS-hosted label viewer.
- Export PAS 2060-style certificates.
- Full audit trail with on-chain hash reference.

| 2 | Product Carbon Footprint Recording |
| 3 | Smart Contract for Retirement & Label Minting |
| 4 | Green Label Generator (QR + IPFS) |
| 5 | Verification Dashboard (React) |
| 6 | Admin Portal (Offset Approval & Audit Trail) |
| 7 | Partner API (Emission Submission & Label Fetching) |
| 8 | Certificate Engine (PDF + JSON-LD generation) |
| 9 | Deployment Plan (CI/CD, Env Setup) |

---

## üîê Smart Contracts

### `UCRCreditToken.sol`
- ERC-1155 tokenization of credits.
- Stores credit metadata and handles retirement.

### `CarbonRetirement.sol`
- Links product emission to credit token.
- Retires credits and emits event logs.

### (Optional) `GreenLabelNFT.sol`
- Mints ERC-721 NFT for verified carbon-neutral products.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Data & Metadata

- Product emissions are stored in DB.
- Labels are JSON-pinned to IPFS.
- Each product ‚Üí batch ‚Üí credit ‚Üí retirement is fully traceable.
